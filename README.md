The "Diamond Price Prediction" project 💎📈 focuses on developing machine learning models to predict diamond prices using the "Diamonds" dataset from Kaggle. 
This dataset includes 53,940 observations with 10 features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, length, width, and height.

Project Steps 🛠️

-Data Exploration and Preprocessing 🔍:

Analyzed diamond features to understand their distribution and relationships with price.
Handled categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalized numerical variables using StandardScaler to enhance model performance.

-Model Development and Training 🤖:

Utilized scikit-learn's Pipeline to create processing chains that include normalization and model training.
Trained various algorithms, including:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
SGD Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
XGBoost Regressor

-Model Evaluation 📝:

Employed metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score to assess model performance.
Compared results to select the optimal model.


Conclusions
The project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting diamond prices, combining data exploration, preprocessing, and the application of various machine learning algorithms.
